# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a = 16
print(bin(a))
```
## Output
![442892759-23e036bf-9310-495e-8883-0a068b5cece1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9de7c63-6ec4-4612-aa8c-c12ec6e91e2f)

## Result
The program successfully converts the number 16 into its binary representation and prints it.
